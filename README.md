# studying-Web-1
This repo is my study space for Web One. I’m learning the basics of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m using this place to store my notes, assignments, and practice code. It’s simple, casual, and a way to track my progress as I grow from beginner exercises to better, more polished projects.
